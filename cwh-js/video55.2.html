<!-- 
    This code creates two promises, p1 and p2, that simulate asynchronous operations using setTimeout. Both promises log some messages to the 
    console to show their state, either fulfilled or rejected.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

javascript
Copy code
let p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("promise pending");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("i am promise and fulfilled");
    resolve(true);
  }, 5000);
});

let p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("promise pending");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("i am promise and rejected");
    reject(new Error("i am error"));
  }, 5000);
});

console.log(p1);
console.log(p2);
When this code is executed, it will output the following to the console:

arduino
Copy code
promise pending
promise pending
Promise { <pending> }
Promise { <pending> }
The messages "promise pending" are logged for each promise, indicating that they are in the pending state. After 5 seconds, p1 will be fulfilled 
and log "i am promise and fulfilled" to the console, resolving with the value true. On the other hand, after 5 seconds, p2 will be rejected and log "i am promise and rejected" to the console, rejecting with a new Error object.

Note that when we log p1 and p2 to the console, we see that they are both Promise objects in the pending state. This is because the setTimeout
 function is used to delay the fulfillment or rejection of the promise, and the console.log() statements are executed immediately.
