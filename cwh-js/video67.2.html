p.json is not a function error

The error "p.json is not a function" occurs because fetch method returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object. However, the json() method is not available on the Response object directly.

You need to call the json() method on the Response object after it is resolved from the Promise. Therefore, you should replace the line:

csharp
Copy code
let response = await p.json()
with:

csharp
Copy code
let response = await p;
let data = await response.json();
return data;
This will wait for the Promise returned by fetch to resolve with the Response object. Then, the json() method will be called on the Response object to extract the JSON data, which is then returned from the createTodo function.

if i dont write await p

If you don't use the await keyword to wait for the p Promise to resolve before calling the json() method, then the json() method will be called on the Promise object itself, which does not have a json() method, resulting in a TypeError.

To correctly extract the JSON data from the response, you need to await the p Promise to resolve first, and then call the json() method on the Response object that is returned from the fetch call.

Here's the updated code with the corrections:

javascript
Copy code
const createTodo = async () => {
    let options = {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "content-type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            title: 'foo',
            body: 'bar',
            userId: 1
        })
    }

    let p = fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', options)

    let response = await p;
    let data = await response.json();
    return data;
}

createTodo().then(result => console.log(result))
With this updated code, the createTodo() function will correctly wait for the p Promise to resolve before calling the json() method on the Response object to extract the JSON data from the response.




Aman Choudhary
but p will return a promise so why await

You are correct that fetch returns a Promise, which means that p is a Promise object. However, you still need to use the await keyword to wait for the Promise to resolve before using the json() method.

The reason for this is that the json() method is not available on the Promise object returned by fetch. Instead, it is available on the Response object that is returned when the Promise is resolved.

By using the await keyword, you are telling the JavaScript engine to wait for the Promise to resolve and return the Response object before continuing to the next line of code. This allows you to call the json() method on the Response object to extract the JSON data from the response.

If you do not use the await keyword, then the json() method will be called on the Promise object itself, which does not have a json() method, resulting in a TypeError.
