<!-- 
   
    The reason we need two .then() functions in this code snippet is that fetch() method returns a Promise object that resolves to the Response object representing the HTTP response from the server.

The first .then() function is used to convert this Response object to a JSON object, which is another Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.

The second .then() function is used to access the resolved JSON data returned by the first .then() function and log it to the console using the console.log() method.

So, the first .then() function is used to process the Response object and convert it to JSON format, while the second .then() function is used to access and process the actual data returned by the API.
