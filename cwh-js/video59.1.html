<!-- 
    async/await is a modern way of handling asynchronous code in JavaScript. It was introduced in ES8 (ECMAScript 2017) and provides a cleaner 
    and more readable syntax for dealing with Promises.

In traditional Promise-based code, you would use then() and catch() methods to handle the resolved and rejected states of a Promise. However, 
this can lead to nested and confusing code, commonly referred to as "callback hell".

With async/await, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.

Here is a basic example of async/await:

javascript
Copy code
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
In this example, the getData() function is declared as an async function. Inside the function, we use the await keyword to wait for the Promise
 returned by the fetch() method to resolve. We then use another await keyword to wait for the Promise returned by the json() method to resolve, 
 which will give us the actual data. Finally, we log the data to the console.

The try-catch block is used to handle any errors that might occur during the asynchronous operation.

async/await is especially useful when you need to perform multiple asynchronous operations in sequence, as it allows you to write code that looks 
more like synchronous code.

 <!-- 
  fetch is promise or not ?

Yes, the fetch() function in JavaScript returns a Promise. The Promise resolves with a Response object when the request is successful and rejects 
with an error when the request fails. This allows you to handle the response asynchronously using methods like .then() and .catch(). Here's an
 example:

javascript
Copy code
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
In this example, the fetch() function returns a Promise which is then used to handle the response asynchronously. The then() method is used to 
parse the response as JSON and log the data to the console. The catch() method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the request.
