/*
Yes, you're correct. If a derived class (Dog in this case) has its own constructor, it must call the super() method before it can use this. The super() method is used to call the constructor of the parent class (Animal in this case) and pass the necessary arguments.

In the example you provided, the Dog class has its own constructor that logs the name parameter to the console, and then calls the super() method to call the constructor of the parent class with the same name parameter. This is necessary to properly initialize the name property of the Animal class.

After calling super(), the Dog class can use this to access the properties and methods of the parent class, including the speak() method. In this case, the speak() method of the Dog class overrides the speak() method of the Animal class, and logs a different message to the console.

When the dog.speak() method is called, it outputs "Rex barks." to the console, which is the expected result.

here this is giving error it is used before super why ?

The error "this is used before super" occurs because the this keyword is used in the constructor of the Dog class before calling the super method. In JavaScript, the super method must be called before the this keyword can be used inside the constructor of a derived class.

In the example you provided, the console.log(${this.name}) statement in the constructor of the Dog class tries to access the name property before calling super(name). This causes an error because the name property has not been initialized yet, since it is defined in the constructor of the parent class.

To fix this error, you can move the console.log(${this.name}) statement after the call to super(name), like this:

javascript
Copy code
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    console.log(`${this.name}`);
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

let dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Output: "Rex barks."
Now the super method is called before using the this keyword, and the name property is properly initialized, so the code should work correctly.

what does this super do

In object-oriented programming, super is a keyword that refers to the parent class of a derived class. It is used to call the constructor and methods of the parent class from within the derived class.

In JavaScript, when a class extends another class, it is considered to be a derived class or a subclass, and the class that it extends from is the parent class or the superclass.

When the super keyword is used in a subclass constructor, it calls the constructor of the superclass with the same arguments passed to the subclass constructor. This initializes the properties of the superclass and allows the subclass to inherit these properties.

For example, in the code you provided, the Dog class extends the Animal class, so it inherits the name property from the Animal class. The super(name) method in the Dog constructor calls the Animal constructor with the name argument passed to the Dog constructor, which sets the name property of the Animal class to the same value.

This allows the Dog class to access the name property using this.name, even though it is defined in the Animal class.

In summary, the super keyword in JavaScript is used to call the constructor and methods of the parent class, which allows the subclass to inherit and use the properties and methods of the superclass.
