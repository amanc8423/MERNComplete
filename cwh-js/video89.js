// hoisitng - the proprty of js to move declration on top of rspective scope but ony declaration not initilization
// it is for declaration not for initializtion

console.log(a);
var a = 5;

// console.log(a1);  error hoisitng not for let and const
// let a1 = 5;



b();
function b(){console.log("dfdf")};

//b1(); //  error bec declaration not initlization and in this b is not function
var b1 = function(){console.log("dfdf")}; // function and class expression are not joisted

let z;
console.log(z);

why hoisiting nt work for let

Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript where variable declarations are moved to the top of their respective scope, allowing them to be accessed before they are declared. However, the behavior of hoisting differs for let and const variables compared to var variables.

While var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with a value of undefined, let and const declarations are also hoisted to the top of their scope, but they are not initialized. This means that if you try to access a let or const variable before it is declared, you will get a ReferenceError.

For example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
let a = 5;
In this example, trying to access the variable a before it is declared results in a ReferenceError, because let declarations are not initialized before their declaration is reached during the execution of the code.

To avoid this issue, it is recommended to always declare your variables at the beginning of their respective scope. This ensures that your variables are properly initialized before they are accessed.

if let is not initialize then it can say undefined why error

You are correct that let variables, like var variables, are automatically initialized to undefined by the JavaScript engine during the creation phase of a scope. However, the reason that accessing a let variable before it is declared results in a ReferenceError is because of the way that JavaScript performs variable hoisting.

When JavaScript code is executed, variable and function declarations are processed before any code is executed. This process is called hoisting. For var declarations, the variable is hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized to undefined. This means that you can access a var variable before it is declared, but the value will be undefined.

However, for let and const declarations, while the declaration is still hoisted to the top of its scope, the variable is not initialized. This means that if you try to access a let or const variable before it is declared, you will get a ReferenceError, since the variable has not yet been initialized to any value, not even undefined.

So, in summary, even though let variables are automatically initialized to undefined, accessing a let variable before it is declared still results in a ReferenceError because of the way that hoisting works for let and const declarations in JavaScript.
