<!-- Yes, alert, prompt, and confirm are part of the Browser Object Model (BOM) in JavaScript.

The BOM is a collection of JavaScript objects and interfaces that allow JavaScript code to interact with the browser and the web page being displayed. It includes objects such as window, document, navigator, and location, as well as methods such as alert, prompt, and confirm.

These three methods (alert, prompt, and confirm) are used to display dialog boxes on the screen to the user, and they are part of the window object in the BOM. The alert method displays a message box with an OK button, prompt displays a message box with an input field and OK and Cancel buttons, and confirm displays a message box with OK and Cancel buttons.

So, in summary, alert, prompt, and confirm are part of the Browser Object Model in JavaScript, specifically as part of the window object.
