<!-- 
A request header is a part of an HTTP request that contains information about the request itself, such as the type of request being made, the 
client making the request, the server being contacted, and any data being sent as part of the request.

Request headers are sent by the client to the server as part of an HTTP request, and they can contain various types of information, such as:

The type of request being made (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
The URL of the requested resource
Information about the client making the request (e.g., user agent, IP address, etc.)
Any authentication credentials required to access the requested resource
Any cookies associated with the request
Any custom headers that the client wishes to include
Request headers can be added to an HTTP request using various programming languages and tools, such as JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest object, the
 fetch() method, or server-side programming languages like PHP or Python.
