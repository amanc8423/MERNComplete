// hoisitng - mechanism of moving declaration of variables and function on top of current exceution context
// let and const are hoisted but they are hosted differently

// var varibe values are stored in global scope
// memory for let and const are given in separate memory space

// temporal dead zone - time since let varible was hosited till it is initialized a value
