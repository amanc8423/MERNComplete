// ECMAScript and JavaScript are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two. ECMAScript is a specification that defines the syntax, semantics, and behavior of a scripting language. JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript specification.

// JavaScript is the most widely used implementation of ECMAScript and is used extensively for web development. Other implementations of ECMAScript include JScript and ActionScript.

// JavaScript has evolved over the years to include new features that were added to the ECMAScript specification. For example, ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced new features such as let and const for variable declaration, arrow functions, and classes. These features were later implemented in JavaScript engines in web browsers and Node.js.

// In summary, ECMAScript is a specification that defines the scripting language while JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript specification.


// we can also run js online on repli 

// js is programming lang used to make interactive web pages
