// nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
// global module - here we install nodemon as global module npm install nodemon -g
/* Global modules in Node.js are modules that can be used across multiple Node.js applications without the need to install them locally in each application. They are installed globally on the system and are available to all Node.js applications running on that system.  */
// global modules must be use carefullly as they can cause effect in other project so download modules  each project separately for every project
// nodemon is not added in package.json
// to use it write nodemon {filename} it will automatically run for given file
